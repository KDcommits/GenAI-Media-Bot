ADDITIONAL IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR CANDIDATES 68  P a g e | 1 INFORMATION BROCHURE for Ph.D., M.Tech., M.S.(R), M.Des., M.P.P., and M.Sc. Admissions Sem II l IIT DELHI MESSAGE TO THE APPLICANTS FROM THE DEAN, ACADEMICS I am very happy to note that you are planning to pursue your postgraduate education, and in particular you are considering IIT Delhi as one of your choices. India\"", "[3] \"is fast emerging as a knowledge economy and in the next decade or so, we would emerge as a major centre for research and technology development. In this context, your decision to pursue post-graduate education would definitely have a significant impact on your long-term career prospects. IIT Delhi with its 31 Ph.D., 41 M.Tech., 16 M.S.(R), 5 M.Sc., 3 M.B.A., one M.P.P. and one M.Des. Programmes, offers you extensive choices of specializations. The strength of the Institute is its 600+ highly qualified faculty, due to which it is continuously ranked among the top technical institutions globally. As you may be aware, IIT Delhi is recognized as an Institution of Eminence (IoE) by the Government of India. While this is a great recognition, it is also a great responsibility on all of us and indeed our prospective PG students, to take this Institution to even greater heights. We would like you\"", "[3] \"to consider joining us in this journey. At the time of writing this letter, we are opening up the campus after two years of restricted activity and online classes due to the pandemic. We hope that the future semesters will be person, and the campus is gearing up to welcome all students: new students and currently registered students, to learn and enjoy the experience of the IIT Delhi campus. That said, as we open up, it is extremely important to adhere to Covid-appropriate behavior and whatever restrictions that will need to be in place for the coming few semesters. In the last few years, we have constantly been working towards making our rules, regulations, and policies governing post-graduate education flexible and attractive to potential candidates. I am writing this letter to make you aware of some major policy changes in the last couple of years. 1. At IIT Delhi, most\"", "[3] \"of the academic Departments/ Centres/ Schools offer M. Tech. and Ph.D. programmes, while some of them also offer an M.S.(R) programme. It is possible for a student to switch from one programme to another any time after one semester of joining. For example, a candidate joining an M. Tech. programme can apply for the switch to a Ph. D. programme in the same Department (or even in another eligible Department), after completing 12 credits of courses with a minimum CGPA of 8.0. All his/her earned credits, if relevant to the new programme, can be considered in the new programme as well. Similar flexibility exists for switching between other programmes. 2. In the last year, IIT Delhi has initiated sponsored research activities worth around Rs. 350 crores which are expected to grow further this year. Candidates wanting to gain project experience along with post-graduate education can apply and join one of\"", "[4] \"the sponsored projects simultaneously with admission to the post-graduate degree. Apart from gaining experience, various schemes may provide for higher assistantship amounts with your participation in the sponsored research projects. One significant policy change that has been adopted is that the recruitment for the project can also be carried out by the same Department/ Center/ School Research Committee (DRC/CRC/SRC) that admits students to the postgraduate programmes.  P a g e | 2 INFORMATION BROCHURE for Ph.D., M.Tech., M.S.(R), M.Des., M.P.P., and M.Sc. Admissions Sem II l IIT DELHI 3. IIT Delhi is striving towards ensuring that each of its Ph.D. students has an opportunity to present a paper and attend at least one international conference before they graduate. We offer a certain quantum of financial support to all full-time research scholars to present their research at up to two international conferences. 4. We have also introduced a new scheme\"", "[4] \"under which highly meritorious research scholars are awarded a further opportunity for presenting their work at another conference, provided they have demonstrated sustained excellence in their research. 5. Our post-graduate programmes are highly flexible, which offer students a variety of courses and research topics to choose from. 6. Meritorious students with a bachelor\u2019s degree (such as B. Tech.) are advised to directly apply for the Ph. D. programmes if they wish to pursue doctoral research. Details about direct admission to Ph. D. for B. Tech- qualified students are available in this brochure and also on our website. Of course, students who already hold a Master\u2019s degree are welcome to apply for Ph.D. 7. IIT Delhi is actively promoting post-graduate research in inter-disciplinary areas, and you are invited to avail of this exciting opportunity. In addition to such research being pursued in our regular Academic Units, we also have a School\"", "[4] \"of Interdisciplinary Research (SIRe) wherein candidates with a diversity of backgrounds seek admission to pursue a Ph.D. degree involving faculty supervisors in different Academic Units and expertise, jointly supervising the student. Please look for more details on inter-disciplinary research on our website. 8. IIT Delhi, as a part of its Institution of Eminence (IoE) initiatives, is moving rapidly to welcome meritorious candidates for pursuing Ph.D. from other countries. As part of this, International students wanting to pursue PhD degree at IIT Delhi (who are not availing a scholarship from any other source) are entitled to a merit-based fellowship under the International PhD Fellowship Programme (IPFP). More information on this scheme and other details for international students are available at: http://intladm.iitd.ac.in 9. From Academic Year 2020-21, IIT Delhi has also started a new scholarship scheme for international students wishing to pursue M. Tech. / M. Des. / MS(R), under the newly\"", "[5] \"launched \u201cInternational Masters Scholarship Programme (IMSP)\u201d. Under this scheme, international students wishing to pursue either of M. Tech., M. Des., or MS(R) degrees in IIT Delhi, and secure an admission offer from the respective Department or Centre or School within IIT Delhi, are entitled to be considered for a limited number of merit-based scholarships. Those international students who have successfully cleared the Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE examination: http://gate.iitd.ac.in/) are also entitled to a scholarship for pursuing their masters degree in IIT Delhi. More details of on the IMSP scheme are available at: http://intladm.iitd.ac.in 10. IIT Delhi is an active participant in two flagship MHRD schemes: the Prime Minister\u2019s Research Fellowship (https://pmrf.in/) and the Scheme for students in ASEAN countries to pursue PhD in IITs (http://asean.iitd.ac.in/). The latter scheme entitles students from ASEAN countries (https://asean.org/asean/asean-member-states/) to pursue PhD with a  P a g e | 3 INFORMATION BROCHURE\"", "[5] \"for Ph.D., M.Tech., M.S.(R), M.Des., M.P.P., and M.Sc. Admissions Sem II l IIT DELHI full scholarship at any of the IITs, including IIT Delhi. Potential PhD candidates from the ASEAN member countries interested in pursuing their PhD degree in IIT Delhi are strongly encouraged to avail this facility. 11. Under the PMRF scheme (https://pmrf.in/), Indian students of high merit from who have completed their bachelors degree, or pursuing their masters or PhD degrees in top Indian institutions may be considered for a merit-based premier scholarship. Potential candidates are encouraged to apply under this scheme, and seek details at the website. There is also a \u201clateral entry\u201d option into PMRF for students who join the PhD program and demonstrate academic excellence within the first few semesters of their residence in the PhD program. 12. IIT Delhi is also an active participant in the Prime Minister's Fellowship for Doctoral Research, which is\"", "[5] \"a joint venture between SERB and CII / FICCI for supporting industry- sponsored PhD projects. Research scholars who get engaged in industry-sponsored projects are advised to apply for this scheme. 13. At IIT Delhi, we are engaged in two Joint Ph.D. programmes, one with University of Queensland, Australia (www.uqidar.org), and other with National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Taiwan (www.ncyu.edu.tw). While for the UQ-IITD programme, the admission is through a separate channel (details on the website: www.uqidar.org), for NYCU the entrance is after the selection of students into the regular IITD Ph.D.programme. You may wish to note that IIT Delhi has a larger number of students in post-graduate programmes than in undergraduate programmes. We urge you to consider us as your institution of choice to further your goals of getting a higher professional degree. One point needs some mention. Owing to our rapid growth in recent years and also delayed\"", "[5] \"construction activity owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, we are facing acute shortage of campus accommodation (hostels). Due to this, some of our PG students may need to stay outside campus, at least in the initial period of their study. IIT Delhi will do everything possible to facilitate the stay outside campus (if necessary). We expect the crunch of hostel accommodation to ease out in the coming years, but for now we as a community need to live with the constraints. There are many more things I would like to share with you once you are selected to our PG programmes and wish to join IIT Delhi. I am looking forward to seeing you in the Orientation Programme with you being accepted for admission in one of your preferred postgraduate programmes. Please note that in view of the evolving situation related to the COVID-19 outbreak, the dates may change. Hence, please\"", "[7] \"keep checking for updates on the IIT Delhi website.

The student\u2019s overall progress through the programme is measured by the number of credits that he/she has completed satisfactorily. A minimum Grade Point Average (average score based on grades obtained, weighted by the corresponding credits of each course), is required to be maintained for satisfactory progress. The minimum academic requirements for the various degrees, including minimum and maximum credits to be registered in a particular semester, are indicated in the Courses of Study for the year 2022-2023, which will be made available on the Institute Website before the date of Orientation. Every course is coordinated by a member of the teaching staff of the Department/ Centre/ School which offers the course in a given semester. This Faculty member is called the Course Coordinator. He/she has\"", "[10] \"full responsibility for conducting the course, coordinating the work of the other members of the faculty involved in that course, and for holding tests and assignments and awarding grades.

Admissions Sem II l IIT DELHI Department of Physics [Code PHZ] Condensed Matter Experiments: The research activity of condensed matter experimental (CME) group at the Physics department covers a wide range of topics such as (i) nanostructured materials, thin films and devices, (ii) novel magnetic multifunctional and topological materials, (iii) spintronics and magnetism, and (iv) wide band gap semiconductors such as GaN and Ga2O3, AlGaN/GaN heterostructures, 2D quantum materials like grapheme, transition metal dichalchogenides and thin-films of half Heusler alloys Growth and nanoscale devices based on semiconductor nanowires, and (v) optical properties of condensed matter e.g., ultrafast dynamics of condensed matter with femtosecond laser. CME group\"", "[47] \"houses several specialized laboratories as well as several departmental facilities. The CME group has close links with Central Research facilities (CRF) and Nanoscale Research Facility (NRF) of the Institute. NRF houses Class 100 and 1000 clean rooms as well as several characterization facilities. At present, the department has an X-Ray diffractometer, an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, a SQUID magnetometer, a physical property measurement system (PPMS), ultrafast-optics laboratory (also housing a Raman spectrometer and a photoluminescence set-up), a pulsed laser deposition (PLD) system and an atomic force microscope as departmental facilities. Individual research labs also have several state-of-the-art facilities, the details of which can be found by visiting the corresponding laboratory web pages. Condensed Matter Theory: The CMT group has an interdisciplinary focus with broad research interest spanning form first principles-based simulation of designing new materials and understanding their properties using \u201cstate-of-the-art density functional theory (DFT) and beyond methods\u201d to the theoretical\"", "[47] \"modelling transport and other properties of various condensed matter systems.

Admissions Sem II l IIT DELHI Statistical and Computational Physics: Statistical Physics is devoted to understanding macroscopic assemblies of identical particles. Such systems appear over a wide range of length scales in many different fields. We study diverse systems of contemporary interest, ranging from classical solids, exotic liquids, soft materials, mesoscopic systems and active matter to name a few. Broadly, our research encompasses the following themes: (i) emergent phenomena in complex spin systems with disorder and long-ranged interactions; (ii) non-equilibrium properties of complex fluids such as liquid crystals, ferronematics and patchy colloids; (iii) miniature heat engines,\"", "[48] \"and particle and heat transport in mesoscopic systems; (iv) motility of micro-organisms on surfaces and micro-swimmers in Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids; (v) pattern formation in granular materials; and (vi) mechanics of extremely flexible structures such as thin films. We use a variety of analytical techniques from equilibrium and non-equilibrium statistical physics, computational techniques such as Monte Carlo, parallel tempering, molecular dynamics and graph cuts along with experiments involving state-of-art imaging techniques and sensitive mechanical characterization. High Energy Physics: High energy physics encompasses both the very small and the very large distance scales \u2014 of elementary particles (femtometer scale) and of the observed universe (cosmology)! It is well described by the standard model, which brings together three fundamental interactions \u2014 electromagnetic, weak and strong. Collider physics is a tool which combines both perturbative and non-perturbative aspects of these interactions. We study particle production in collider interactions in an attempt to understand\"", "[48] \"both. In particular, strong interaction, described by quantum chromodynamics, is per se notoriously difficult. We employ effective field theoretical techniques to understand its non- perturbative aspects \u2014 to study low energy properties of hadrons and quark gluon plasma. We also use them to study particle production in gravitational fields, and also some aspects of quantum gravity. Standard model, though stupendously successful, is still incomplete which makes HEP even more exciting. There are several theoretical problems; even more, there are experimental hints for rich physics beyond the standard model. We study this in the context of topics such as neutrino physics and dark matter. Optics and Photonics: Historically the Physics Department at IIT Delhi has a strong background in broad areas of Optics and Photonics. IIT Delhi started the first Optics Master's program in the country in 1960's. At present the Physics Department has approximately 15 faculty members engaged in Optics\"", "[49] \"and Photonics related research. Current research activities span a wide ranging topics that include areas of fundamental importance (e.g. Physical Optics, Statistical Optics, Singular optics and inhomogeneous polarization states, quantum photonics, non-linear optics, nano-photonics/metamaterials, light propagation in random media) as well as cutting edge applied research areas (e.g. integrated optics and optical communication, holography, microscopy/nanoscopy, optical metrology, computational imaging, green photonics, illumination engineering, bio-photonics including applications to medical diagnostics, THz optics, ultrafast optics, spectroscopy, optical tweezers, beam engineering, atmospheric optics and development of optical sensors). Optics and Photonics faculty have number of collaborations across different disciplines within IIT Delhi (electrical engg., biosciences/biomedical engg., material science,  P a g e | 47 INFORMATION BROCHURE for Ph.D., M.Tech., M.S.(R), M.Des., M.P.P., and M.Sc. Admissions Sem II l IIT DELHI chemistry), as well as outside IIT Delhi with DRDO, ISRO and other national research facilities like CSIR labs, as well as medical\"", "[49] \"schools/hospitals (e.g. AIIMS), and industry. The department hosts a DST-FIST facility on ultrafast optics that has state-of-the-art instrumentation enabling collaborative work with various disciplines. Physics of Quantum Materials & Information Systems: The 3 focused attempts in quantum computation (QC) are- (i) Majorana-based topological quantum computation (TQC) (ii) superconducting qubits-based QC and (iii) trapped ion-based QC. Importance of the field is evident from the fact that Google and IBM have invested heavily in superconducting qubits while Microsoft has invested in Majorana qubits. The focus of our department is towards (i) cold atom-based quantum technologies, (ii) quantum photonics and (iii) general Quantum Materials like Topological Insulators, quantum well based semiconductor technologies, spintronics related research etc. In cold atom-based technologies, the atoms are cooled to million times colder than room temperature using precisely frequency tuned lasers. The inherent quantum nature of atoms and photons allows one to design versatile quantum systems and fully\"", "[49] \"control their properties by simple and clever approaches. These technological and conceptual developments will lead us to build large scale quantum information processing network, quantum computation protocols for solving industry and society relevant problems. A group of researchers, in the department are putting their efforts in the direction of studying Topological semi-metals, a quantum phase of matter that host Dirac and Weyl fermions. They study the transport properties of these exotic materials under very low temperature, high magnetic field and high pressures and realise the exotic quantum features in the laboratory scale. Plasma Physics: Plasmas are known to be the fourth state of matter. These contain large number of positive ions and electrons in almost equal number along with some neutral particles. Negative ions can also occur in plasmas and also there can be dust particles, referring to them as multi- component / dusty plasmas where the charge neutrality holds\"", "[50] \"good. However, the dynamics of plasma greatly alters due to the presence of such additional charges. Each plasma species can contribute to different application of plasma. For example, electrons are responsible for high frequency phenomena including EM radiation generation, whereas the ions contribute to the synthesis of materials, surface hardening, sputtering, deice fabrication etc. We are primarily working in the broad research areas of intense laser-plasma interaction, plasma- material interaction, plasma propulsion, plasma-based radiation sources, and dusty plasmas. We employ theoretical approach including nonlinear physics as well as numerical methods, namely, hydrodynamics, molecular dynamics and particle-in-cell (PIC) techniques to investigate some of the above areas and also perform experiments.

We are also interested in development of equipment which are useful in atomic physics experiments and our aim is to collaborate with the industry to make them commercially available. Astrophysics: Research in the Astrophysics group at the Physics Department, IIT Delhi revolves around open questions such as: \uf0a7 What is the small-scale structure of space time? \uf0a7 How do the matter and gravity interact in the quantum picture? \uf0a7 What leads to the emergence of \"classical\" reality? \uf0a7 What are the quantum effects in gravity and how to test them?
